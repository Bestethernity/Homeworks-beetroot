#Task 2
#Create a python program named "task2", and use the built-in function 'print' in it several times.
#Try to pass "sep", "end" params and pass several parameters separated by commas.
#Also, provide a comment text above each print statement, mentioned above,
#with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.
print("Hello world")
print("hello", "world", sep='---',end='!') #two words separated with --- and with the ! symbol at the end
print(1,2,3,4,5, sep='-')
#using \n to separate the lines
print("hello", "world", sep='---',end='!\n')
print(1,2,3,4,5, sep='-')
#Task 3
#Write a program, which has two print statements to print the following text
#(capital letters "O" and "H", made from "#" symbols):
#Pay attention that usage of spaces is forbidden, as well as creating the whole result
#text string using """ """, use '\n' and '\t' symbols instead.

print('#########\n','#\t\t#\n','#\t\t#\n','#\t\t#\n','#########\n\n','#\t\t#\n','#\t\t#\n','#########\n','#\t\t#\n','#\t\t#\n')
